							<h6 class="text-uppercase">THE CLIENT</h6>
							<p>Meguiar‚Äôs continues to be a leader in retail car care, occupying the #2 POS spot in both the US and Canada. While the US enjoys high brand awareness, our 2019 Canadian consumer segmentation study found that Meguiar‚Äôs has only 10% unaided brand awareness and 39% aided brand awareness.</p>
							<p>Meguiar's products are a way to provide car crazy enthusiasts an opportunity to express their utmost pride with their vehicle and overall passion for the car hobby. Barry Meguiar explains, ``We are car guys who happen to be in the car wax business. The ultimate experience for us comes when our two passions merge in the exhilaration of ``Best of Show`` winners who regularly use our products.``</p>
							<p>The Canadian retail car care category is growing at a modest rate of 3%. The season runs from late April to late October, depending on geography and weather. The retail landscape is dominated by Canadian Tire, with 89% of consumers heading there for car care products.</p>

								<h6>SEGMENT 1, PAUL</h6>
								<p>‚Ä¢ Deeply cares about vehicle appearance <br>‚Ä¢ Engaged in car enthusiast hobby <br>‚Ä¢ Key drivers: quality & brand <br>‚Ä¢ Meguiar‚Äôs brand awareness: 23%</p>
								<p>Since I retired a couple of years ago, I purchased and restored a beautiful red convertible to treat myself. I have worked hard to get where I am today. I like to splurge once in a while. I like spending time in my car to make sure it looks its best. I only use the best brands and products on my girl. I like Meguiar‚Äôs. I will buy whatever gives me the best results. Price doesn‚Äôt matter. She should always shine like a new penny! I have a whole slew of soaps, shampoos, waxes, polishes, and sponges. I am a frequent shopper at the local auto specialty store. They even know me by name.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="port-content port-content-left">
								<h6>OVERVIEW</h6>
								<p>I first created a word cloud of the existing content from Meguiar‚Äôs website. While the most common words were related to the products and the brand, I felt that there is a lack of emotional phrases or words. Emotion is what convinces a consumer to purchase a product.</p>
								<p>So I began to come up with emotionally responsive words to best describe the brand and the value proposition.</p>

								<h6>SEGMENT2, GORD</h6>
								<p>‚Ä¢ DIY focused: appearance & restoration <br>‚Ä¢ Need for speed <br>‚Ä¢ Key drivers: quality, past use, research <br>‚Ä¢ Meguiar‚Äôs brand awareness: 21%</p>
								<p>I was born and raised on a farm and still live in a small town. I learned how to be very handy. Tools are something I have been using since I was 5 years old. I love working with my hands. I even studied woodworking and am currently a carpenter‚Äôs apprentice. During my spare time, I like to go four-wheeling, dirt biking, and snowmobiling. I get a rush from going fast. My pickup truck if often covered in mud. If I am going out on the town with my girlfriend, I will make sure she looks brand new. I have the cleaning products I need at home and am not afraid to get in all the nooks and crevices.</p>
								<p>My truck has a lot of mileage on it, but I will run this baby into the ground before getting something new. I like to get as much value as possible out of things. My dad and I have no problem fixing any issues on our vehicles. No job is too tough or too big. When it comes to the products we use, we tend to hunt for bargains and often look for what we need at Canadian Tire. I am always open to new products. A brand is not really that important as long as it gets the job done. I want results!</p>
