							<p>shomi! Inc. is an experiential and print company based in Canada.

								<p>I enjoyed working with my client on this project because it was something new for me. The challenge of being involved with a brand that delivers quality work to such a niche market was appealing and exciting for me. During my research and discovery phase with the client, I had to understand the experiential market and how businesses interact with their service providers such as my client. My goal for my research was to look at business to business communication in the industry, client communication, and internal workflow. I also had to look at how shomi currently operates with existing clients in terms of managing their projects internally and how the orders are fulfilled and delivered.</p>

					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-6 col-xs-12">
							<div class="port-content port-content-left">
								<p><b>Customer Service:</b> The most important element and the deciding factor for most clients in the experiential marketing industry, is customer service. Delivering quick custom quotes and estimates plus followups and engagement with the service provider were pointed out by a number of B2B clients.</p>
								<p><b>Quotes & Estimates:</b> Since experiential and printed fabric displays are mostly customized products, it is highly important to provide fast quotation and order estimates for the clients.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="col-6 col-xs-12">
							<div class="port-content port-content-right">
								<p><b>Post Production & Installation:</b> Once a purchase is made and the product is shipped to clients, they always refer to their hardware provider for additional support such as installation documentation and instructions.</p>
								<p><b>Documentation and Downloads:</b> The ability to view and download instructions for product assembly and packaging is highly important to clients. Also for the resellers and affiliates accessing the sales documents quickly can improve their performance.</p>

							<div class="port-content port-content-left">
								<p>The research data and analytics lead to the creation of many personas to get more familiar with the brand target audience. Meet Andrew an auto repair shop owner in Toronto. Passionate about his work and his business, Andrew strongly believes that a experiential marketing and display can greatly impact his shop traffic. He is looking to partner up with a company that can centralize his print marketing and trade show needs.</p>

						<div class="col-6 col-xs-12">
							<div class="port-content port-content-right">
								<p>After understanding the target audience and recognizing their requirements, I had to determine the answer.

								<p>With the new website and product pages ready to go, it was time for me to add copy and content, then optimize the landing pages to gain ranking on the search engines and bring more traffic to the website. This was an ongoing process that took over a year to complete. However, it was important to build impactful landing pages and make sure that they are directed to a very specific target audience about a very specific product. The results were three new product landing pages that generated new traffic on the website and ranked on the top page of search for their related keywords within 6 months. Click here to read the copy I wrote for one of landing pages here.</p>
