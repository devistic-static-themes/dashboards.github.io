							<h6 class="text-uppercase">THE CLIENT</h6>
							<p>False Face is a global electronic music record label based in Canada. False Face collaborates with a roster of artists and events in conjunction with their record releases on the digital music stores. This includes sales on Spotify, Apple, Amazon, Beatport, and other digital music stores. I was approached before the launch, to create the concept for the brand. I was also responsible for art direction for album cover art and marketing content for the brand.</p>
						</div>

					<div class="col-6 col-xs-12">

							<h6>The Challenge</h6>

								<p>For the logo, I wanted to use the Idea of the mask and the two personalities in the story. So creating the feeling of two opposite sides of a visual element was important to me. I started drafting ideas by using the letter F as my main element for the logo. By flipping the letter, I was able to achieve the association with the brand visually and project the message hidden behind it. From that point, I started exploring colors that would complement my main brand colors and then created the typography and the style sheet for the brand.</p>

						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-6 col-xs-12">
							<div class="port-content port-content-left">
								<p><b>Access:</b> Most users want instant access to streaming their favorite music on any device. They turn to social media, Youtube, and Spotify as their main source of listening and interacting with music. Music buyers also spend hours browsing and listening to song previews before making a purchase.</p>
								<p><b>Community:</b> Most music buyers and streamers are influenced by social media and their favorite DJs or influencers. Most purchase music after listening to a sample on social media, or through watching a promo video. The brand needs to have a strong visual social presence.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="col-6 col-xs-12">
							<div class="port-content port-content-right">
								<p><b>Artist Communities:</b> A big portion of electronic music purchases are by other DJ’s and artists. A music label needs to create promos and newsletters before each release to increase exposure.</p>
								<p><b>Song recognition with Apps:</b> Most music listeners and buyers use mobile applications like Shazam to identify songs at events and music festivals. Having a strong brand presence on music recognitions applications can generate plenty of sales and engagement.</p>

								<h5>Visual Design & Branding</h5>
								<p>False Face’s name was inspired by the idea that everyone in our society is putting on a mask to protect their true feelings and identity. And music is the only element that unmasks the listener. So I wanted this idea to be reflected in the design and the feel of the brand. I also wanted to make sure that the brand feels luxurious and more exclusive to the listener. To me, this would create a special bond with listeners, the artists, and fans of the label.</p>
								<p>I envisioned darker colors for the backgrounds, complemented with sharp and shiny elements, perhaps a gold or silver color. My vision was to create a nostalgic feeling for the fans, that represented opening a luxury gift box. I kept thinking about a satin feeling for the surface of the backgrounds and covers, which led to me create dark and slightly noisy backgrounds.</p>

								<h5>Merchandise Design</h5>
								<p>I implemented the concept into apparel and merchandise design for False Face. The merchandise encouraged fans to get more engaged with the label. It gives them a chance to own their favorite album cover as a wearable product. This was another channel to promote brand awareness and generate additional revenue.</p>

It was also a platform to demonstrate the artwork and the artists involved with the brand.</p>

								<p>In 2018 I art directed and produced a stop motion, hand crafted, music video for one of the releases on False Face by Kinza (Artist). The song was called Cupid’s Arrow and had a very animated feel to it. Taking inspiration from the title, I created a number of sequences with stop motion photography and animation. I used coloured paper and a few other props from my studio, to build a story for this music video.</p>
