							<h6>5 ‚Äì Grammarly</h6>
							<p>The best writing assistant on the market! With Grammarly‚Äôs AI-powered writing tool you will never make writing mistakes again. I find it to be a great learning tool for writing as well.

							<h6>4 ‚Äì Adobe Aero</h6>
							<p>Adobe has recently added Adobe Aero to their Creative Cloud collection and it is an absolute treat! Aero allows you to create augmented reality experiences easier than ever. If you are an existing CC user or familiar with Adobe products, the layout and experience will feel comfortable. Ever wanted to create an augmented reality campaign but it seemed too complex? I can assure you that Aero will allow you to push design boundaries and build digital experiences for your brand and clients.</p>
							<p>You can instantly access your files from other Adobe products to build your AR experience. No complex coding is required to make your concept work in the AR environment. If you own an iPad you are going to love this product!</p>
							<p>According to their website, ‚ÄúAdobe machine learning technology mimics real-world lighting on objects without the need for complex models or time-consuming manual rendering. With the right lighting, it‚Äôs easy to make your digital experience blend into reality.‚Äù Now, how great is that? ü§ó</p>
							<p>Aero for desktop also allows you to get more profound and precise with your designs and build more elaborate functionalities.</p>

							<h6>2 ‚Äì Vectary</h6>
							<p>Vectary is an online 3D and AR design tool and by far the most inflectional app for me in 2019. Working with it for the first time felt like my first experience with any Adobe products. With an online engine and a simple user dashboard, it saves a lot of time and processing power for designers. Every once in a while I come across a platform that feels like a game-changer by pushing the boundaries of existing technologies. Vectary is definitely one of them!</p>
							<p>Vectary offers a simple pricing plan, including a free monthly plan with limited functionality and watermarks on exports (great for testing the platform to see what I mean). The paid plan is affordable and worth adding to your digital arsenal, if you are looking to create cool, cutting-edge designs and 3D experiences.</p>
							<p>One of the best features of the platform is the embed option for your 3D designs. The simplest I‚Äôve come across so far. Once you‚Äôve finalized your design in the 3D environment, Vectary will create an iFrame embed code for you that you can place anywhere on your website or landing pages. It is hard to explain how great Vectary is without having you try it for yourself. If you are not ready yet, I still suggest browsing the app for inspiration and ideas.</p>

							<h6>1 ‚Äì Coda</h6>
							<p>From productivity to sales, project briefs, time tracking, CRM and so much more. Coda has continuously improved my daily working process and has made it extremely easy to access, edit and collaborate on my projects. It is one of the simplest applications I have ever used and felt completely hooked! From writing text to organizing bookmarks, creating data tables, and best of all, instantly turning your document into a mobile app with full edit functionality! Also, it is free to use. I highly recommend browsing through their templates for inspiration.</p>
							<p>The usage of Icons and Emojis in Coda is an incredible experience. Just create a new document and try to change the title. The app will suggest related icons to use for your document. These icons are very well designed and you may end up spending a while just browsing the fun illustrations. Also, these icons and symbols make your document look for more and interactive in case you decide to export them. Want to add an image to your document? No problem just drag it in! Same as Gifs. Oh, and you never have to worry about saving documents because they are automatically saved at all times.</p>
							<p>Coda recently introduced a few payment plan options to its platform. The paid plans, in my opinion, are very well justified and make sense for users who need to integrate apps and implement custom formulas. (Because Coda can do that too!). They have great customer support and chat integrated into the app, with a response time of fewer than 24 hours for free or paid users.</p>
