				<h6 class="mb-0">What does this mean for marketers?</h6>
				<p>Eco-friendly brands and “clean” products are gaining in importance among consumers – and retailers at retail outlets. Now people are turning to YouTube to understand this emerging category and lead a more sustainable life. Sustainable transports, zero-waste swaps, and houseplant tours are just some of the new types of videos that appear on YouTube.</p>
				<h6>Your brand can create content that appeals to sustainable consumers.</h6>
				<p>Fashion lovers want to get to know the story behind their clothes. Videos that show and describe purchased products – have been part of the fashion community on YouTube for years. Recently, however, there’s been an increase in sustainable shipments where YouTubers quickly abandon ethical products. In fact, in 2018, Youtube saw a 190% increase in uploads of transportation videos over the year, with the title being “sustainable”, with views on these videos increasing almost 15 times!</p>
				<p>People are increasingly interested in understanding the story behind the products they buy – and the creators help them with it. For example, creators such as sustainable fashion designer Justine Leconte build a large following by telling people where their clothes come from, how to build capsule wardrobes that do not need to be changed every season, and how to find outfits in thrift stores.</p>
				<p>Brands can address this trend by helping potential customers learn more about creating a product. Another fashion brand went behind the scenes of a factory in India making its organic cotton dresses. Adidas used video to explain how it created its range of eco-friendly sneakers.</p>
				<p>YouTube is full of beauty content – from make-up tutorials for women fighting cancer to wedding hair inspiration. It is no wonder that American beauty consumers say it is the # 1 digital source of beauty content. Statistics: 7x increase in monthly video views titled “clean beauty” was seen last October.</p>
				<p>Clean Beauty – make-up and skincare products made of non-toxic, ethical materials – are becoming more and more popular. There is plenty of room for brands to get involved in this area. A recent survey found that American beauty consumers are almost as likely to base their videos on brands and publishers as they are on other users’ product reviews. Some of the most popular videos titled “clean beauty” feature celebrities such as Gwyneth Paltrow, who founded the natural medicine company Goop, and Bare Minerals brand ambassador Hailey Bieber.</p>
				<p>People want to help lead a greener and more sustainable life. Sustainable culture is not just about looking good – it’s about having a good life – in other words, a more sustainable, minimalist lifestyle. Views for Sustainable Life videos that offer tips doubled in 2019 compared to 2018.</p>
				<p>This trend comes alive on YouTube in many ways. For example, a popular category is “zero-waste-swap” videos, in which the developers give tips for products that should be dropped in favor of more sustainable options – for example, metal straws instead of disposable plastic straws. Another way this trend works is the growing interest in downsizing, which in some cases means dropping the creature’s convenience for a more minimalistic existence, such as living in a van.</p>
				<p>Videos related to “van life” recorded a 4 times increase in views last year compared to 2017. The daily calls for houseplants videos increased by almost 62% from 2017 to 2018. A particularly popular genre is the indoor plant tour, where creators show their plants and explain how to look after them.</p>
				<p>Since the beginning of 2019, uploading videos to indoor plants titled “tour” has more than doubled compared to the same period in 2018. These new types of videos and the growing interest in sustainability underscore the new consumer behavior that is likely to remain here for a long time.</p>
