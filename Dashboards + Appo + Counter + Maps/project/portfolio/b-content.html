							<p>bContent is a user-based content marketing platform that allows customers to signup and tries it for free. Users browse through a variety of content writing and lead generation services and make purchases through the platform. Clients can use the internal messaging app on the platform to communicate with the bContent team. They can view order status and make comments on their orders.

							<h6>The Brand</h6>
							<p>I was approached to build a user-based platform to centralize my client’s various content marketing services and websites. To centralize all services, I first had to understand the scope of my client’s service offerings. I was able to finalize a list of 40 services that would be centralized through the platform. The first step was creating a brand name. After my research on SEO, related keywords, and industry competitors, I provided ten possible options for the name to my client. I had my mind sent on bContent and I was happy when the client had the same final choice.</p>

						<div class="col-6 col-xs-12">
							<div class="port-content port-content-left">
								<p><b>Access:</b> Most business owners and content marketers want instant access to centralized content writing and marketing platform. They turn to online digital platforms, Social Media Groups, and YouTube as their main source of news to find industry-related tools and platforms.</p>
								<p><b>Quality & Process:</b> It is highly important to users of the platform to be able to receive quality content for the campaigns. Delivery timelines, customer support, and secure payments were amongst the most important factors in working with an online platform.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="col-6 col-xs-12">
							<div class="port-content port-content-right">
								<p><b>Human Touch:</b> Most business owners and marketers are hesitant to commit to new platforms if they are not able to connect with a human during their first experience with the application.</p>
								<p><b>Measuring Results:</b> Tracking and reporting on order and campaign status also play an important part user’s decision making. If they are paying for services, they expect notifications, followup and project status to be available to them at all times.</p>
