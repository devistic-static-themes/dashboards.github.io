				<h6>SEO is not solely about optimizing your website, but building a reputation and influence online, across all channels, that unavoidably result in increased revenue.</h6>
				<p>Search engine optimization is critically essential for the success and longevity of your brand. It is a vital part of driving qualified traffic and leads to your site. Google‚Äôs latest algorithms reveal that they‚Äôre starting to place more focus on branding. Eventually, this means that the more Google knows about you or your reputation, the better your ranking can get. Higher ranking increases repeat business and client retention. People rarely retain the info they find but do recall how they found it. People do not always remember you and your name, but they‚Äôll likely recall how they met you. I consistently find companies on search whose names and titles I rapidly forget, but I commonly remember the search terms I used to discover them.</p>
				<p>To be able to have consistent results on attracting visitors, you‚Äôve got to optimize your site regularly. Your website ought to be appropriately designed and developed to keep up with the search engine and user behavior.</p>
				<p>If you are building a fresh website, the very best practice is to crawl your brand-new site in test mode before it‚Äôs live. Be confident that the search engine bots are going to be able to crawl your website straight away. Before you begin with some SEO best practices, you should make sure that every part of your website is correctly optimized. You must follow SEO best practices according to the newest search algorithms. Find out more about these algorithms here https://moz.com/google-algorithm-change.</p>
				<h6>Here is a basic checklist to go through when you start your Search engine optimization:</h6>
				<p><b>Research your keywords.</b> Research the keywords your customers would use to find you on search engines. Try using keyword tools that provide insight into the strength of each keyword. KWFinder is one of my favorite tools to use. Check them out at https://kwfinder.com/.</p>
				<p><b>Make sure that all your links are pointing to relevant (and working) URLs</b> and all internal links on your website are correctly connected.</p>
				<p><b>Page titles and Meta Descriptions on your page must always meet search engine standards.</b> Your Page title is what displays on search engine result pages as your heading. It is the clickable headline of your page. Your titles should always be an accurate representation of the content on your website and 10 to 60 characters in length.</p>
				<p><b>Meta descriptions</b> appear directly below your title and motivate users to click. Think of your meta descriptions as advertising copy, sufficiently descriptive and between 50 to 300 characters.</p>
				<p><b>URL‚Äôs for each page on your website must not exceed 75 characters in length.</b> Try avoiding long URL links and choose a human-readable and natural language. Placing the appropriate keywords in your URL also increases your SEO ranking.</p>
				<p><b>Avoid duplicate titles and duplicate content on your pages.</b> Your title tags should have similar content such as your keywords, but make sure they indicate what is different to that page. Consider who your primary searcher is and how they might look for your page, then build your titles around those behaviors.</p>
				<p><b>Name your images correctly.</b> Remember that image names and descriptions play a role in your keyword and SEO ranking. Use your keywords in your image file name. Be sure to describe your images as much as possible in the caption.</p>
				<p>Search engine optimization is an impactful and vital part of building an online brand. There are many other aspects to SEO which may require the assistance of an expert. I can help you build the best SEO strategy for your business.</p>
				<h6>üìã Guidelines:</h6>
				<p><b>1 ‚Äì Must have a Focus Keyword (up to 5 focus keywords)</b> <br>Insert keywords you want to rank for. Exact Keyword Used in Document at Least Once</p>
				<p><b>2 ‚Äì Focus Keyword must appear in the SEO title. Optimal title length: 55 characters.</b> <br>Make sure the focus keyword appears in the SEO post title too.</p>
				<p>Optimal Format <br>&lt;title&gt; Primary Keyword ‚Äì Secondary Keyword ‚Äì Brand&lt;/title&gt;</p>
				<p>Sample <br>&lt;title&gt;SEO Software, Tools and Resources for Better Marketing ‚Äì XYZ&lt;/title&gt;</p>
				<p><b>3 ‚Äì Add Focus Keyword to your SEO Meta Description. 160 characters.</b> <br>Make sure the focus keyword appears in the SEO description too.</p>
				<p>Optimal Format ‚Äì  Meta Description content should be between 50-300 characters, and be a useful description of the page that will drive search clicks.</p>
				<p>Sample ‚Äì  &lt;meta name=‚Äùdescription‚Äù content=‚ÄùGet SEO best practices for the meta description tag, including length and content.‚Äù /&gt;</p>
				<p>Tools: http://tools.seobook.com/meta-medic/, https://www.seoptimer.com/meta-tag-generator,  https://www.seoptimer.com/,  https://app.sistrix.com/en/serp-snippet-generator, https://metatags.io/</p>
				<p><b>4 ‚Äì Use Focus Keyword in the URL.</b> <br>Include the focus keyword in the slug (permalink) of this post.</p>
				<p>Optimal Format www.mysite.com/my-keyword-phrase <br>Sample xyz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo</p>
				<p><b>5 ‚Äì Use Focus Keyword at the beginning of your content.</b> <br>The first 10% of the content should contain the Focus Keyword preferably at the beginning.</p>
				<p><b>6 ‚Äì Use Focus Keyword in the content.</b> <br>It is recommended to make the focus keyword appear in the post content too.</p>
				<p><b>7 ‚Äì Content should be 600-2500 words long. </b><br>Minimum recommended content length should be 600 words.</p>
				<h6>Additional</h6>
				<p><b>Add a short URL</b> <br>Permalink should be at most 25 characters long.</p>
				<p><b>Use Focus Keyword in subheading(s) like H2, H3, H4, etc.</b> <br>It is recommended to add the focus keyword as part of one or more subheadings in the content.</p>
				<p><b>Add an image with your Focus Keyword as alt text.</b> <br>It is recommended to add the focus keyword in the alt attribute of one or more images.</p>
				<p><b>Link out to external resources.</b> <br>It helps visitors read more about a topic and prevents pogo-sticking.</p>
				<p><b>Add DoFollow links pointing to external resources.</b> <br>PageRank Sculpting no longer works. Your posts should have a mix of nofollow and DoFollow links. Details Here</p>
				<p><b>Aim for 1% Keyword Density.</b> <br>There is no ideal keyword density percentage, but it should not be too high. The most important thing is to keep the copy natural.</p>
				<p><b>Add internal links in your content.</b> <br>Internal links decrease your bounce rate and improve SEO.</p>
				<p><b>Back link and ranking.</b> <br>Tools: https://smallseotools.com/backlink-maker/, https://smallseotools.com/keyword-position/</p>
				<p><b>Title Readability</b> <br>Use Table of Content to break-down your text. <br>Table of Contents help break down content into smaller, digestible chunks. It makes reading easier which in turn results in better rankings.</p>
				<p>Calculate Flesch Readability score. <br>Try to make shorter sentences, using less difficult words to improve readability. (Use tools like Grammarly)</p>
				<p>Add short and concise paragraphs for better readability and UX. <br>Short paragraphs are easier to read and more pleasing to the eye. Long paragraphs scare the visitor, and they might result to SERPs looking for better readable content.</p>
				<p>Add a few images and/or videos to make your content appealing. <br>Content with images and/or video feels more inviting to users. It also helps supplement your textual content.</p>
				<p>Use this tool here , https://www.textalyzer.xyz/ , http://www.analyzemywriting.com/ <br>other tools https://datayze.com/readability-analyzer.php, https://www.programmableweb.com/api/readability-metrics, https://readable.com/</p>
				<p>Positivity <br>Positivity defines how positive or negative the context of your email is. The highest response rates come from content that are slightly positive in tone. Positivity is calculated via artificial intelligence, so it may not be 100% accurate ‚Äì when in doubt, trust your judgment.</p>
