								<h6>THE WHAT?</h6>
								<p><b>A crowdfunding platform for live events.</b></p>
								<p>The platform is a funding platform for live events. This program allows Event Organizers and performers to create and manage an event funded by their audience. Everything from Music, Theater and Comedy to Arts, Seminars and public events. The platform is full of great artists and successful events, organized by the most reputable organizers in the industry, which are brought to life through the direct support of the audience!</p>

								<img src="images/portfolio/kickstarter/2.jpg" class="mb-30" alt="">								
								<h6>THE BASICS</h6>
								<p>An organizer creates an event. The artist(s) is selected by the organizer for the event, based on availability through the global calendar. The organizer is also able to add other costs such as Hotels or pick a venue for the event. The event is posted for crowdfunding by the audience, who are rewarded with passes to the funded event. They are also able to rate and review all parties involved in an event.</p>
								<p>The funding goal is the amount of money that an organizer needs to complete the event.</p>
								<p>Funding on the platform is all-or-nothing. No one will be charged for a pledge towards an event unless it reaches its funding goal. This way, organizers always have the budget they scoped out before moving forward.</p>
								<p>An organizer is a person or team behind the event idea, working to bring it to life.</p>
								<p>Audiences are folks who pledge money to join organizers in bringing the events to life.</p>
								<p>Passes are rewards for funding for the audience based on availability and amount of funding. Typically, these are based on the capacity of the venue and number of people the organizers expect, which is calculated in the platform before posting an event.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="port-content port-content-left mt-50">
								<img src="images/portfolio/kickstarter/4.jpg" class="mb-30" alt="">
								<h6>THE PROCESS</h6>
								<p>Everything on the platform must be an organized event based on the availability of the performers, venues, and organizers. An event includes a deadline for funding and the organizer is responsible for making the event come to life. Funding will eventually be completed, and a live event will take place on a specific date inside the venue.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="port-content port-content-left mt-50">
								<img src="images/portfolio/kickstarter/6.jpg" class="mb-30" alt="">
								<h6>WHY FUND EVENTS?</h6>
								<p>Most audiences will rally around their favorite artists and organizers. It gives the audience a sense of involvement in organizing and seeing their favorite artists and performers. It also creates a much stronger bond between the organizers, artist and the audience to create an event together in any location.</p>
								<p>Backing an event is more than just pledging funds to an organizer. It’s pledging your support to the artist and helping them with more bookings in any location internationally.</p>
								<p>Artists can create an event to promote a possible booking for them. However, the artist is still required to create an organizer account to be able to proceed with creating the event for audience funding.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="port-content port-content-left mt-50">
								<img src="images/portfolio/kickstarter/8.jpg" class="mb-30" alt="">
								<h6>SECURITY</h6>
								<p><b>How do I know an event organizer is who they claim they are?</b></p>
								<p>Perhaps you are friends with the organizer, or you heard about the event from a trusted source.</p>
								<p>Looking for more information? Read through the description and watch the video to get a better sense of the person or team behind the event.</p>
								<p>In the organizer/artist bio section of each event, you can find additional resources, like links to websites, relevant background information, and in some cases, a connected Facebook account. The organizer of the events, artists, and venues can verify their identity through an automated process. If you have more questions, you can send the creator a message to ask them.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="port-content port-content-left mt-50">
								<img src="images/portfolio/kickstarter/10.jpg" class="mb-30" alt="">
								<p><b>What is an organizer obligated to do once their event is funded?</b></p>
								<p>When an event is successfully funded, the organizer is responsible for completing the event and fulfilling each pass. Their fundamental obligation to the audience is having the performer present at the promised venue on the chosen date. Once an organizer has done so, they’ve fulfilled their obligation to their audience. At the same time, audiences must understand that the platform is not a store. When you back an event, you’re helping to create an event with your desired performer available to perform at a specific location. There’s a chance something could happen that prevents the organizer from being able to finish the event as promised. If an organizer is unable to complete the event, they must make every reasonable effort to find another way of bringing the vent to a satisfying conclusion for their audience.</p>
								<p>Can the platform refund the money if an event is unable to fulfill?</p>
								<p>No, this platform doesn’t issue refunds. Transactions are between audiences and organizers directly. Organizers receive all funds soon after their campaign ends.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="col-6 col-md-12">
							<div class="port-content port-content-right">								
								<img src="images/portfolio/kickstarter/3.jpg" class="mb-30" alt="">								
								<h6>THE HOW</h6>
								<p>Thousands of events are funding on the platform at any given moment. Each event is independently created and crafted by the organizers behind it. The artist and event organizers you see on the platform have complete control and responsibility for their events. They spend time building their event pages, shooting their videos, creating artwork and brainstorming how to bring the best experience to their audience. When they feel ready, an organizer can launch their project on the site and share it with their audience based on location and availability.</p>
								<p>Every event organizer sets the event’s funding goal and deadline. If people like the event, they can pledge money to make it happen. If the event succeeds in reaching its funding goal, all the audience’s credit cards are charged when the time expires. If the event falls short, no one is charged. Funding on this platform is all-or-nothing.</p>
								<p>Once the event is successful and has reached its goal, all the necessary payments will automatically be transferred to venues, artists and organizers. For example, if the organizers have calculated and booked in advance, the hotel cost of booking their artist, the fees will also be paid automatically through the platform.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="port-content port-content-right mt-50">
								<img src="images/portfolio/kickstarter/5.jpg" class="mb-30" alt="">
								<h6>WHY ALL OR NOTHING?</h6>
								<p>All-or-nothing funding is a core part of the platform and it has several advantages:</p>
								<p>It’s less risky for everyone. If you need $5,000, it’s tough having $1,000 and a bunch of people expecting you to complete a $5,000 project. For organizers, most logistics will be taken care of and fully paid as soon as the event reaches its goal.</p>
								<p>It motivates. If the audiences want to see an event come to life, they’re going to spread the word.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="port-content port-content-right mt-50">
								<img src="images/portfolio/kickstarter/7.jpg" class="mb-30" alt="">
								<h6>THE FEES</h6>
								<p>If an event is successfully funded, the platform applies a 5% fee to the funds collected. Our payments processor will also apply payment-processing fees (roughly 3-5%). If funding isn’t successful, there are no fees.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="port-content port-content-right mt-50">
								<img src="images/portfolio/kickstarter/9.jpg" class="mb-30" alt="">
								<p><b>Why can’t the platform guarantee events?</b></p>
								<p>This platform is a new way for organizers, artists, and audiences to work together to make an event come to life. Many traditional events are risk-averse and profit-focused, and tons of great artists and audiences are not able to connect due to difficulties around organizing an event. This platform opens the door to a world full of great events and creative event organization, one where anyone can help decide which artist or performer should perform in which location in the world and make their dream event come to life. </p>
							</div>
							<div class="port-content port-content-right mt-50">
								<img src="images/portfolio/kickstarter/11.jpg" class="mb-30" alt="">
								<h6>SUPPORT</h6>
								<p><b>What should organizers do if they’re having problems completing their event?</b></p>
								<p>If problems come up, organizers are expected to post an event update explaining the situation. Sharing the story, speed bumps and all, is crucial. Most audiences support events because they want to see the performers they’d like to be a part of it. Organizers who are honest and transparent will usually find audiences to understand.</p>
								<p>If the problems are severe enough that the organizer can’t fulfill their event, organizers need to find a resolution. Steps should include offering refunds, detailing exactly how funds were used, and other actions to satisfy their audience. </p>
