							<h6 class="text-uppercase">THE ASK</h6>
							<p>One of the most important parts of planning to attend an event is to build a Personal Schedule on the mobile app. The general purpose of the Personal Schedule on this event app is to let users browse through the Event Schedule and add shows/conferences/panels they are interested in, to their Personal Schedule. Once that’s done, users need to be able to easily see and manage their Personal Schedule before and during the event.</p>
							<p>With this information, I had to describe the thought and UX design processes behind a successful Personal Schedule creation. What are the main criteria to measure said success? What are the most important factors to take into account while designing the user journey? Now, they wanted to add sharing possibilities so that users can share with their friends their Personal Schedule. How would I modify my proposition to accommodate that need?</p>
							<p>I was also asked to provide an overall UX analysis of this event mobile application.</p>

						<div class="port-content port-content-right">
							<h6>CURRENT STATE</h6>
							<p>The current state of Personal Schedule (favorites) on the mobile application:</p>

					<div class="row align-items-center">
						<div class="col-6 col-md-12">
							<div class="port-content port-content-left">								
								<h6>STRATEGY</h6>
								<p>I focused on what ``personal`` means in the application environment. Personal Schedule meant having instant and easy access to personal information:</p>
								<p>- Browse events related to shows/conferences/panels <br>- Browse events by date <br>- Favorite events <br>- Share Events</p>
								<p>Emphasis: <br>- Easily filter events by shows/conferences/panels <br>- Focus on encouraging users to share events <br>- Boost user experience with designing the calendar-based event listing</p>

								<h6>RESEARCH</h6>
								<p>I looked at recent reviews and customer feedback on the App store to gain some knowledge of the overall performance of the application. I discovered 3 Apps related to this brand on the AppStore.</p>
								<p>Main Observations: <br>- Issues with User Authentication are repeatedly mentioned in customer reviews. <br>- Average user rating 2.83 out of 5</p>

								<h6>ANALYSIS</h6>
								<p>- Emphasis on the Favorite & Share button <br>- A better view of the Calendar on the Event Listings <br>- Easier access to filers for categories: shows/conferences/panels</p>
								<h6>DESIGN</h6>
								<p>I then sketched some of my ideas for the ``favorites`` and the ``event Listing`` pages.</p>
								<h6>PRODUCTION</h6>
								<p>I turned my final sketches to build a prototype of the pages I had designed to demonstrate the new functionalities and appearance.</p>
